# Reinforcement Learning

Two examples for presenting at the Advanced Machine Learning class at CEU Vienna.<br>
These are stored in the respective notebooks (altogether with training in: [*Q-Learning_Deep_RL_examples.ipynb*](https://github.com/me9hanics/RL-presentation-tutorial/blob/main/Q-Learning_Deep_RL_examples.ipynb), and separately with less explanation-exploration in *Q-Learning_Cartpole.ipynb, Deep_RL_Atari_Breakout.ipynb*).<br>

<br>The first example constructed by me on how one could train a RL model for the CartPole experiment/game, highlighting the possible mistakes one would make when naively designing a model for this problem. The second example is taken from the [Keras website](https://keras.io/examples/rl/deep_q_network_breakout/) (building on the DeepMind Atari paper) on using Deep Q-networks for the Atari Breakout game.
